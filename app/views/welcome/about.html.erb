  <h1>sched.do</h1>

  <p>
    Make scheduling simple and social with sched.do. sched.do is your personal
    administrative assistant here to free you from the headache of scheduling.
    Simply create any kind of event - a team meeting, group lunch, holiday party
    or coffee with friends - then invite attendees to vote on the best date and
    time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sched.do application was created by
    <%= link_to 'Yammer', 'http://yammer.com' %> in partnership with
    <%= link_to 'thoughtbot', 'http://thoughtbot.com' %>. The code is
    <%= link_to 'open-source and available on GitHub',
    'https://github.com/yammer/sched.do' %>. It is tightly integrated with the
    <%= link_to 'Yammer API', 'https://developer.yammer.com/restapi/' %> and
    showcases Yammer integrations such as logging in with Yammer (OAuth2),
    activity stories, messaging your coworkers, messaging groups, and open graph.
    sched.do integrates with the Yammer API using the
    <%= link_to 'Yam gem', 'https://github.com/yammer/yam' %>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you
    <%= link_to 'log in via Yammer',
    'https://developer.yammer.com/authentication/' %>
    and begin to enter text into the invitee field, sched.do uses Yammer's
    <%= link_to 'autocomplete endpoint',
    'https://developer.yammer.com/restapi/#rest-autocomplete' %>
    to suggest groups and users to invite. Groups and users are invited to the
    event via
    <%= link_to 'Yammer private messages',
    'https://developer.yammer.com/restapi/#rest-messages' %>
    and group postings, respectively. Invitees can also be reminded to vote on
    an event using private messages.
  </p>

  <h1>Open Graph</h1>

  <p>
    An <%= link_to 'Open Graph', 'https://developer.yammer.com/opengraph/' %>
    object is created for each sched.do event and an Open Graph Object Feed
    appears at the bottom of each sched.do event. As the Yammer documentation
    states, "OG feeds can effectively become a commenting system for internal
    blogs or any line of business application." Using the Open Graph feed, any
    company can have a comment thread about a sched.do event that is seamlessly
    integrated with its Yammer network. In addition, event creation, updates,
    sharing, and voting are all shared as activity stories on a user's Yammer
    network via Yammer's Open Graph integration.
